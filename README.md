# single_image_to_partial_3dmodel_generater
this basic python script uses GNPL model to recunstruct a partial 3d model through just a single image.
Why i said partial! because it uses only single image to recunstruct 3d model thats why it can only cunstruct area of the model which is visible in the image.
